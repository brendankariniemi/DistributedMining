## 1. Introduction

Cryptocurrency mining is a crucial process for securing blockchain networks, involving individuals or groups using computational power to solve cryptographic puzzles and verify transactions. Despite its importance, the entry barrier due to hardware costs, energy consumption, and setup complexity is high, and the return on mining can be inconsistent. This project aims to make cryptocurrency mining more accessible and consistent by offering mining pools, lowering the barrier to entry and enabling broader participation.

## 2. Project Idea

### 2.1 Overview

#### Education
Our platform will include a section with detailed information about mineable cryptocurrencies, such as market value and estimated returns, each linked to a mining pool.

#### Peer-to-Peer Mining Pool
Users with capable hardware can contribute their computing power to the pool and receive payouts based on their contributions, making this process more efficient than solo mining.

### 2.2 Application Components

#### Client Side
- **User Interface:** Displays user-contributed resources and earnings.
- **Educational Resources:** Provides information about mineable cryptocurrencies.

#### Server Side
- **Mining:** Manages puzzle solving using the total compute pool.
- **Earnings Calculation:** Distributes earnings based on user contribution.

#### Database
- **User Data:** Stores personal info and mining pool logs.
- **Mining and Financial Data:** Contains blocks mined, hash rate, and transaction data.

## 3. Scope and Outcomes

The project's goal is to develop a versatile platform that lowers the barrier to entry into cryptocurrency mining using pools. Key outcomes include a user-friendly interface and backend processing handled by the server. For educational purposes, payment simulations might be necessary.
